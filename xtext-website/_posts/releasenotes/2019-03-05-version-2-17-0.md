This release focuses on stability, performance and the compatibility with Eclipse 2018-03.

## BOM

TODO

## Java 11

TODO

### MWE 2.10

TODO

### JUnit 5 support

The package `org.eclipse.xtext.testing.extensions` introduced with release 2.14 is now public API, thus users of Xtext JUnit 5 support will no longer receive restricted API usage warnings.

The New Project Wizard selects JUnit 5 as default.

## Customizable exception handling of validation code

By default Xtext swallows `NullPointerException` occuring during the execution of validators. While this behavior is desirable in most cases and users are not bothered with faulty validation or the likely case of NPEs caused by accessing unresolvable proxies, it may be desirable to report or rethrow these exceptions. To minimize the effor of customizing, the handling of exceptions is delegated to the new API method `AbstractDeclarativeValidator#handleExceptionDuringValidation(Throwable)`. Clients may overroide this method to change the exception handling behavior in their validator classes.
