This release focuses on the compatibility with Java 11 & Eclipse 2019-03, stability, performance and technical debt reduction.

## BOM

Xtext 2.17 introduces a new artifact, a [Maven BOM (_bill of materials_)](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies). Basically it is an artifact with packaging type `pom`, which defines dependencies by a `<dependencyManagement>` section. A BOM is consumed by client projects also by `<dependencyManagement>` and using the BOM artifact with scope `import` there.

The BOM declares all dependencies that are used by Xtext and has the coordinates

- `groupId` : `org.eclipse.xtext`
- `artifactId` : `xtext-dev-bom`

The `xtext-dev-bom` is used in Maven configurations as follows:

```
	<dependencyManagement>
		<dependencies>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>org.eclipse.xtext</groupId>
				<artifactId>xtext-dev-bom</artifactId>
				<version>${xtext.version}</version>
				<type>pom</type>
				<scope>import</scope>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
	</dependencyManagement>
```

Any artifact declared by the BOM (e.g. Eclipse Core, EMF, MWE, Guava, LSP4J, JDT, ANTLR) can then be used without declaration of a version.

With Gradle 5 support of [BOM managed dependency versions](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0/userguide/managing_transitive_dependencies.html#sec:bom_import) was introduced. The Xtext BOM can be consumed by Gradle projects with the `platform` dependency:

```
	dependencies {
		compile platform("org.eclipse.xtext:xtext-dev-bom:${xtextVersion}")
	}
```


## Java 11

Xtext and Xtend now fully support Java 11! With Xtext 2.16 it was already possible to run Xtext on a Java 11 VM, but it was not possible to use Java 11 also as the target Java version. Since this required Java 11 enabled versions of Eclipse JDT, Tycho and Gradle and not all were available and especially not tested with Xtext, we had to defer the full support to 2.17.

Now with that latest and greatest versions of JDT, Tycho and Gradle integrated, there are no restrictions to use Java 11 in any of the configurations.


## Customizable Exception Handling of Validation Code

By default Xtext swallows `NullPointerException` occuring during the execution of validators. While this behavior is desirable in most cases and users are not bothered with faulty validation or the likely case of NPEs caused by accessing unresolvable proxies, it may be desirable to report or rethrow these exceptions. To minimize the effort of customizing, the handling of exceptions is delegated to the new API method `AbstractDeclarativeValidator#handleExceptionDuringValidation(Throwable)`. Clients may overroide this method to change the exception handling behavior in their validator classes. ([to issue](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/983))

## Guava 21.0 Version Pinning

Xtext allowed a version range from 14.0 to 21.0 for the Guava library in the past. Effectively this range became invalid since API introduced with Guava 20.0 was used in Xbase. The open version range lead also to other surprises in the past.

With Xtext 2.17 it was decided to pin the required version of the Guava library to 21.0 only. This affects all bundle manifests for plugin builds as well as Gradle & Maven builds through the introduced BOM (see above). Also the _New Project Wizard_ will respect this restriction for newly created projects. ([to issue](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1391))

## Xtext Grammar Language

### New Validation: First Rule Must Not Be a Fragment

An Xtext grammar's first rule must not start with a fragment rule. This is now checked by an additional validation rule. ([to issue](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/pull/1041))

## Testing

### Hyperlinking

A new base class `AbstractHyperlinkingTest` has been added to provide a convenient way to test hyperlinking navigation.

All standard example projects have been updated to provide a test class (`<LangugageName>HyperlinkingTest.java`) for demonstration. ([to issue](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-eclipse/issues/949))

### JUnit 5 Support

The package `org.eclipse.xtext.testing.extensions` introduced with release 2.14 is now public API, thus users of Xtext JUnit 5 support will no longer receive restricted API usage warnings.

The _New Project Wizard_ selects JUnit 5 as default.

## xtext-maven-plugin

### Output Configuration Name

It is now possible to configure set the `name` attribute for non-default output configurations. ([to issue](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-maven/issues/62))

### Upgrade to Maven 3 API

The `xtext-maven-plugin` has been refactored to use the latest Maven 3 API. The most significant internal change is that all doclet based configurations have been changed to use Maven 3 annotation API.

## xtext-web

The Xtext web support has been updated to the latest versions of the used libraries and editors. Particularly we upgraded to:

- requirejs 2.3.6
- jquery 3.3.1-1
- ace 1.3.3
- codemirror 5.41.0
- Orion 17


## Upgrades

Xtext builts on top of numerous technologies which frequently provide releases. An important task is therefore to keep up-to-date with the latest from the used technology stack. All upgrades affect Xtext in multiple ways:

- All internal usages for building Xtext use the upgraded versions
- The _New Project Wizard_ produces projects that make use of upgrades
- Our provided Oomph setup has been updated to reflect the latest changes

### Eclipse 2019-03

As member of the Eclipse Simultaneous Release Xtext is also built against the latest target platform 2019-03.

### Gradle 5.1.2

We upgraded to Gradle 5.1.2. This version is used especially to support the introduced Maven BOM (see above) "natively" in Gradle configurations.

### Tycho 1.3.0

Tycho 1.3.0 is required especially for full Java 11 support.

### MWE 2.10

Xtext is now the latest release 2.10 of the Modeling Workflow Engine (MWE). The MWE project has been updated to use a recent Xtext version itself and supports now separate source folders for main sources and tests.

### Eclipse Orbit

Xtext uses the Orbit repository [https://download.eclipse.org/releases/2019-03/](https://download.eclipse.org/releases/2019-03/) for third party libraries. The location redirects to the latest repository recommended for the simultanous release.
