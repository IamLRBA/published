This is a hotfix release. Here is the list of fixed issues:

- There was a [bug](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=545343) in the Xtext Builder that leads to non Xtext projects being built by Xtext.
- The [LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/1059) version in Xtext 2.17.0 did not match the one in Eclipse 2019-03. Upgraded to LSP4J 0.7.0.
- The [Xtend Batch Compiler](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/750) preferred classes found on the classpath over local classes.
