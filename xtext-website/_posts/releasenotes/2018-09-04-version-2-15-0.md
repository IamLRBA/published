This release focusses on stability, performance and the integration in Eclipse 2018-09. 

## Minimal Required Target Platform

Xtext and Xtend 2.15 are built and tested against Eclipse Oxygen 3a and newer. Thus we recommend to use at least Eclipse Oxygen 3a or even better Eclipse 2018-09. For older versions of the Eclipse Platform we cannot guarantee backwards compatibility even though we carefully assess any changes that are made. 

## Support for designated test source folders

Recently Eclipse started to support Java projects with additional source folders that are specifically used for test sources. The project layout thus is more flexible and can be aligned with Maven or Gradle defaults. sources. Test folders are highlighthed in the UI and the class path for test sources and non-test sources are separated. This ensures that production code does not reference any test code. The Xtext new project wizard now ensures that new projects mark their source folders appropriately.

## Improved Progress Reporting

The progress reporting for the Xtext builder was enhanced and does now provide more detailled information about the current task. Especially for full builds it is not easier to estimate the remaining time.

## Task tags and TASK tags

The Xtext API for ToDo task tags now supports case sensitive patterns such that a TASK can be rendered differently than a mere Task.

## Navigation in External Files

The editing experience for files that are not contained in a workspace has been improved. Navigation and editing works more reliable now.

## API Improvements

The API when working with the Xtext documents was improved. Convenience methods have been added that are more robust against broken document content when the model is accessed from units of work. If you don't want to see any null resource or if you want to handle exceptions specifically when accessing the model, you may want to use [`tryModify`](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/blob/master/org.eclipse.xtext.util/src/org/eclipse/xtext/util/concurrent/IWriteAccess.java#L53) or `tryReadOnly` respectively. 

## LSP4J 0.5.0

We have updated to LSP4J 0.5.0 which adds support for semantic highlighting.

## Update Gradle to 4.9

We have upgraded Gradle to 4.9. New projects are built against the this version.
