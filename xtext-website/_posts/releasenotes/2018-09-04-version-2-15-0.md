This release focus on stability, performance and integration in eclipse 2018-09. The new features are limited in scale.

## Minimal Required Target Platform

Xtext and Xtend 2.15 are built and tested against Eclipse Oxygen 3a and later. Thus we recommend you to use at least Eclipse Oxygen 3a. For older Eclipse Platform versions no guarantees can be given.

## Mark test source folders

Java projects in eclipse allow to mark source folders to contain test sources. These folders are highlighthed in the UI and the class path for test sources and non-test sources are seperated. This ensures that production code does not reference testing code. The new project wizard for Xtext projects now ensures that new projects mark their source folders appropriatly.

## Improve Progress Reporting

The progress reporting for the builds was enhanced. Esspecially for full builds you should now able to estimate the remaining time much more easy.

## Update Gradle to 4.9

We have upgraded gradle from 4.6 to 4.9. Your new projects will now initially be build with this verison.
