## New API For EMF Model Manipulation

The `IChangeSerializer` is a new API to listen to changes that are made to the EMF model of an XtextResource and serialize them back to the document's text. It has a number of benefits to the old `XtextDocument.modify()` approach:

* Direct integration with the formatter, such that changes are automatically nicely formatted.
* Minimum text region changes resulting in less noise.
* Many points to hook into, e.g. for automatic update of an import section.
* More ways to optimize for a specific language and to tune performance.
* Independence from Eclipse-UI concepts like the `Document`. This makes it reusable in languages server implementations.

You can use the `IChangeSerializer` for refactorings, semantic quickfixes, code lens etc. It still has a few limitations, e.g. it does not work with derived state models, that's why we keep it provisional for now. 

Nevertheless, we have added the following new features based on it:

### Rename Refactoring Service for Language Servers

One of the missing services of the Language Server Protocol was `rename`. This is now available. You can customize it by overriding `IRenameStrategy2` or hooking into the change serializer.

### Rename Participants for Eclipse File Operations

Some languages tie the model file name to the content, like the package declaration in Java. For such cases you might want to participate in operations on files or directories, like move, rename or paste, to adapt your models automatically. Based on the new `IChangeSerializer` we have implemented some generic file refactoring participants. You will get notified of such changes to react appropriately by registering your own `IResourceRelocationStrategy`.

```	
<extension point="org.eclipse.xtext.ui.resourceRelocationStrategy">
   <strategy class="mydsl.MydslExecutableExtensionFactory:mydsl.MydslResourceRelocationStrategy">
   </strategy>
</extension>
```

### Alternative Rename Refactoring for Xtext

By enabling `useChangeSerializer` flag in the workflow of your language 
```
Workflow {
  component = XtextGenerator {
    ...
    language = StandardLanguage {
      ...
      renameRefactoring = {
        useChangeSerializer = true
      ...
```
you will use an new, alternative rename refactoring for Eclipse based on the `IChangeSerializer`. This flag will also generate the binding for the `IRenameService` and thereby enable rename refactoring on your language server.

### Multi-Quickfixes

These are quickfixes that allow to be applied to multiple markers at once. 

TBD


Xtext 2.13.0 improves the support of language servers.

## New Project Wizard: Language Server Build

The New Project Wizard allows now to build an executable distribution of language server. On the advanced page a new option was added which is enabled when a Build System was selected. The option allows the selection of a distribution type:

* **Regular**: A batch script is created that is used to start the server. The DSL jars and all of its runtime dependencies are copied to the output folder.
* **Fat Jar**: The language server is packaged in a single executable jar.

Both Gradle and Maven are supported. When activated, the build script of the language's Generic IDE project is extended and the language server is packaged to the project's build

## Configuration Error Detection

Invalid combinations of bundles are a frequent source of errors. This can be caused by an invalid mixture of Xtext's UI and runtime plugins, or by DSL plugins developed with a different version of Xtext than used in the environment where it fails.

Although there can't be done anything to get the plugins working on an invalid environment, the resulting failure messages were not good for the user, leaving an impression of an unstable framework.

When running in an error during the initial creation of Guice injectors in the DSL's UI or Xtext's Shared UI bundle, the error is catched and an analysis of the runtime environment is included in the failure message. This allows better analysis of the root cause.

## Xbase Lib: flatMap extension method

A new convenience method `flatMap` has been added to `IterableExtensions` and `IteratorExtensions`, which combines `map` and `flatten`.

```
@FinalFieldsConstructor
@Accessors
class Planet {
	final String name
	final List<Moon> moons
}

@FinalFieldsConstructor
@Accessors
class Moon {
	final String name
}


class Planets {
	def static void main (String[] args) {
		
		val Iterable<Planet> planets = #[
			new Planet("Earth", #[new Moon ("Moon")]),
			new Planet("Mars", #[new Moon ("Phobos"), new Moon("Deimos")])
		]
		
		val moonNames_old = planets.map[moons].flatten.map[name]
		val moonNames_new = planets.flatMap[moons].map[name]
	}
}
```
