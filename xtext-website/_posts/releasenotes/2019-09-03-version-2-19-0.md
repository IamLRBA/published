Xtext 2.19.0 is mainly a maintenance release.

## Eclipse Integration

TODO

## LSP Integration

Xtext 2.19 now uses LSP4J version 0.8.0 / Language Server Protocol version 3.14.0. This allows you to consume Xtext Language Servers by WebSocket.

## Upgrades

Xtext now uses Guava 27.1.0. The new version will be picked up automatically if you make use of the Xtext BOM or consume Xtext from its P2 repository.
The MWE(2) version was updated to 2.11.

## Gradle

We made building Xtext projects and Xtext itself Gradle 6.0 ready and thus future-proof.

## Maven Tycho

For our integration of Eclipse Tycho based builds with Eclipse Orbit we now make use of the new Orbit Simrel Alias [https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/2019-09](https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/2019-09) instead of our own solution [https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/orbit/2019-09](https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/orbit/2019-09).

## Infrastructure

Xtend now is built on the new Kubernetes based CBI infrastructure. TODO
