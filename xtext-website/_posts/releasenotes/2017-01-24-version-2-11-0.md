Version 2.11.0 is the first release of Xtext after its big internal restructuring. The successful core of Xtext is used in many applications and projects around the world, as a result our main focus for 2.11 has been keeping the high quality and stability of the project while setting the course for a more sustainable future.

## Language Server Protocol

With 2.11 the Xtext project supports the [language server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) (LSP), which will allow users to host their languages in many different editors. So far LSP support for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the Eclipse IDE, [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/), [Eclipse Orion](https://orionhub.org), and Emacs exists. Furthermore Microsoft's monaco editor provides support and can be integrated in any JavaScript application.

The LSP support in Xtext v2.11 is marked as provisional to leave open the possibility to further enhance the architecture and API. That said it is known to be used in commercial products already. Also in the long term the LSP support might replace the native [web-editor support]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/330_web_support.html).

## Old Xtext Generator Deprecation

With Xtext 2.9 a [new generator infrastructure was introduced]({{site.baseurl}}/releasenotes.html#/releasenotes/2015/11/16/version-2-9-0). In favor of this new generator [the old generator has been deprecated](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/58). Bugfixes will be done primarily for the new generator and most of them will not be backported, thus it is highly recommended to migrate your languages' `.mwe2` workflows to use the new [`org.eclipse.xtext.xtext.XtextGenerator`]({{site.src.xtext_core}}/org.eclipse.xtext.xtext.generator/src/org/eclipse/xtext/xtext/generator/XtextGenerator.xtend) component.

## IDE Guice Module

Xtext uses [dependency injection with Guice]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/302_configuration.html#dependency-injection) for language-specific configuration. There are separated hierarchies of Guice modules that aim at different integration platforms: [Runtime]({{site.src.xtext_core}}/org.eclipse.xtext/src/org/eclipse/xtext/service/DefaultRuntimeModule.java) (core services used by all language integrations), [Eclipse]({{site.src.xtext_eclipse}}/org.eclipse.xtext.ui/src/org/eclipse/xtext/ui/DefaultUiModule.java), [IDEA]({{site.src.xtext_idea}}/org.eclipse.xtext.idea/src/org/eclipse/xtext/idea/DefaultIdeaModule.xtend), and [Web]({{site.src.xtext_web}}/org.eclipse.xtext.web/src/main/java/org/eclipse/xtext/web/server/DefaultWebModule.xtend). The 2.11 release introduces a new [IDE]({{site.src.xtext_core}}/org.eclipse.xtext.ide/src/org/eclipse/xtext/ide/DefaultIdeModule.xtend) module hierarchy, which is used for generic editor and IDE features. This new module is employed by the [web-editor support]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/330_web_support.html) and the LSP support, but not by the Eclipse and IDEA integrations.

The new IDE module brings reusability of many language-specific services, but the price for this is some API breakage. If you are already using the web-editor support, you'll need to make a few changes to your language configuration:

- Remove constructors from `<Language Name>WebModule`. ExecutorServices are now managed by the [ExecutorServiceProvider]({{site.src.xtext_core}}/org.eclipse.xtext.ide/src/org/eclipse/xtext/ide/ExecutorServiceProvider.xtend) and disposed by the [DisposableRegistry]({{site.src.xtext_core}}/org.eclipse.xtext.util/src/org/eclipse/xtext/util/DisposableRegistry.xtend).
- Move custom bindings for generic IDE services from `<Language Name>WebModule` to the new `<Language Name>IdeModule` (e.g. content assist).
- Fix `<Language Name>WebSetup` and `<Language Name>Servlet`; if unsure how to do that, delete them, re-run the language generator workflow, and reapply any customizations you made.

## Fixed Bugs

In addition to the restructuring and the LSP support many bugs have been fixed:
