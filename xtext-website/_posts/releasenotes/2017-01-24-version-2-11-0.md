Version 2.11.0 is the first release of Xtext after its big internal restructuring.
The successful core of Xtext is used in many applications and projects around the world, as a result our main focus for 2.11 has been
keeping the high quality and stability of the project while setting the course for a more sustainable future.

## Language Server Protocol

With 2.11 the Xtext project supports the [language server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) (LSP), which will allow users to host their languages in many different editors.
So far LSP support for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the Eclipse IDE, [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/), [Eclipse Orion](https://orionhub.org), and Emacs exists. Furthermore Microsoft's monaco editor provides support
and can be integrated in any JavaScript application.

The LSP support in Xtext v2.11 is marked as provisional to leave open the possibility to further enhance the architcture and API. That said it is known to be used in
commercial products already. Also long term the LSP support might replace the native web-editor support.

## Old Xtext Generator Deprecation

With Xtext 2.9 a [new generator infrastructure was introduced](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/releasenotes.html#/releasenotes/2015/11/16/version-2-9-0). In favor of this new generator [the old generator has been deprecated](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/58). Bugfixes will be primary done for the new generator and most of them not backported, thus it is highly recommended to migrate your language's `.mwe2` workflows to use the new [`org.eclipse.xtext.xtext.XtextGenerator`](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/blob/master/org.eclipse.xtext.xtext.generator/src/org/eclipse/xtext/xtext/generator/XtextGenerator.xtend) component.
