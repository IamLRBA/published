Xtend version 2.11 comes with a new source repository and plenty of improvements and bug fixes.

## New Source Repository

The Xtend code base has been moved to a dedicated repository [xtext-xtend](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend) in the course of the restructuring of Xtext (see the [Xtext 2.11.0 Release Notes](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/releasenotes.html)).

## The Xtend Language and Library

### String Concatenation Performance Improvements

The performance of string concatenation, e.g. as used for rich strings, [has been improved](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=427909). This change has important consequences for working with Xtend: you should make sure that you use consistent versions of Xtend in your host IDE and your target platform in order to avoid [compatibility problems](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/122).

### Improved Compiler

The Java code produced by the Xtend compiler is now [less verbose and more readable](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492072). For many situations Xtend does not produce synthetic variables anymore.

For [switch statements on Strings](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501975) an additional null guard is produced. This lead to NPEs when a null argument was passed to the switch statement.

A for-loop over an array resulted in uncompilable Java code. This has been [fixed](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=440006).

### Comparison with null

For comparison expressions with `null` as argument it is more efficient to use the triple (not) equals operator `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`. While the "normal" operators will result in a call of `Objects.equal`, the triple equals operator can perform a direct comparison.

For these situations [a warning is produced](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=401012) and [a quickfix is offered](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=403018).

## New Class Wizard

The New Xtend Class wizard has an option to create a main method.
