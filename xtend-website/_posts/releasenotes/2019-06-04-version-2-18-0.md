INTRO TEXT MISSING

## Ternary Expressions

Xtend now allows to use the ternary operator. This enables to assign conditional values to variables in the shortest possible way, as already well known from Java.

```
val v = condition ? “thenValue” : “elseValue”
```

If it is disapproved to use ternary expressions, it is possible to flag them with an error and convert them via quickfix into a traditional if-expression.

```
val v = if(condition) “thenValue” else “elseValue”
```

## Try With Resources

Try statements are often used with resources, that have to be closed in the finally block. Xtend now supports the convenient try-with-resources expression. This closes the opened resources automatically at the end of the try block - without having to code that explicitly.


```
def m() {
    val resource = new StringReader("This \n is a text!");
    try
        return resource.read
    finally
        resource?.close     
}
```

Becomes:

```
def m() {
    try (val resource = new StringReader("This \n is a text!"))
        return resource.read
}
```
