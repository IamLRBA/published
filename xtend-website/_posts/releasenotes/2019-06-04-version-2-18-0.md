Xtend 2.18.0 provides new language features (Ternary Expressions and Try-With-Resources) and some smaller improvements.

## Ternary Expressions

Xtend now allows to use the ternary operator. This enables to assign conditional values to variables in the shortest possible way, as already well known from Java.

```
val v = condition ? “thenValue” : “elseValue”
```

If it is disapproved to use ternary expressions, it is possible to flag them with an error and convert them via quickfix into a traditional if-expression.

```
val v = if(condition) “thenValue” else “elseValue”
```

## Try With Resources

Try statements are often used with resources, that have to be closed in the finally block. Xtend now supports the convenient try-with-resources expression. This closes the opened resources automatically at the end of the try block - without having to code that explicitly.


```
def m() {
    val resource = new StringReader("This \n is a text!");
    try
        return resource.read
    finally
        resource?.close     
}
```

Becomes:

```
def m() {
    try (val resource = new StringReader("This \n is a text!"))
        return resource.read
}
```


## Eclipse Integration

### New Quickfix: Rename Class

When an Xtend class name does not match the file name it is defined in then Xtend raises a warning. A new quickfix has been provided to rename the class according to the file name. ([#744](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/744))

### Quickfix "Remove Unused Member" Improved

The quickfix "Remove member" for unused members was improved. Additionally to the member itself the quickfix will now also remove obsolete import statements and write accesses. ([xtext-xtend](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/736))

### Xtend Elements Wizards in Project Explorer / Navigator View

Context menu entries to trigger New Wizards for Xtend elements were only offered in the Package Explorer. These entries are now additionally offered in the context menu in the Project Explorer and Navigator views. ([xtext-xtend#699](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/699))

## Maven Integration

When the goal `xtend-install-debug-info` is executed on empty source directories, a warning is raised by default:

```
[WARNING] Directory <SOURCE_DIR> is empty. Can't process.
```

This warning can now be suppressed by configure the new parameter `showEmptyDirWarning` to `false`. ([xtext#787](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/787))

## Xtend Compiler

The Xtend batch compiler lookup order preferred classes in jars on the classpath before local classes that are on the source path. The order has been changed so that local classes are now first on the search path. ([#750](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/750))
