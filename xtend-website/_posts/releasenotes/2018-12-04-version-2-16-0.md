This release focuses on stability, performance and the compatibility with Eclipse 2018-12.

## Hover and Hyperlink on links in Javadoc comments

Inside Xtend source files, hovering over a link inside a Javadoc will now display the Javadoc comments in a hover pop-up. F3 is also supported on these links.

## Triple-equals quickfix is now a multifix

Warnings of the type `The operator '!=' should be replaced by '!==' when null is one of the arguments.` could only be fixed one by one. The quickfix has been extended to allow fixing multiple issues at once.

## Deprecation of GWT

We will no longer maintain the GWT versions of Xbase and Xtend Lib. The corresponding jars will be no longer published with future versions of Xtext (likely from 2.17 on).

## Outlook for 2.17

Java 11 Support, a Maven BOM and a new MWE version are planned for 2.17.

## Fixed Issues

As in every release cycle we were eagerly hunting down bugs, and reviewed and integrated plenty of contributions. More than 90 issues and almost 300 pull requests have made it into this release. For further details please refer to the following lists:
