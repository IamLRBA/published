Xtend 2.20.0 is mainly a maintenance release with a small number of usability improvements

## Eclipse Integration

### New Refactoring: Import Static Method and Import Static Extension Method

Two refactoring commands have been added which can add as static or static __extension__ import the selected static method call and update all the occurrences in the document. The refactoring commands can be triggered from the `Refactoring > Import Static | Import Static Extension` context menu in the Xtend editor or using `M1+Shift+M` and `M1+Shift+Alt+M` key shortcuts. ([#751](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/751))

### Improved JUnit test case recognition/execution

The Xtend IDE has been improved to recognize and execute all JUnit test cases (implemented in Xtend) event if the cursor is currently located before/after the test class definition.

### New Quick Fix: Add JUnit 4 or 5 to the classpath

A quick fix was added which adds the necessary libraries for JUnit 4 or 5 to the classpath. The quick fix will show on import errors starting with `org.junit.jupiter` (for JUnit 5) or `org.junit` (for JUnit 4). It works both for plug-in projects and regular Java projects. ([#919](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/919)
