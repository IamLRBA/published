Xtend 2.21.0 is mainly a maintenance release with a small number of usability improvements

## Xtend Compiler

### Unnecessary modifiers

The Xtend compiler has been improved to avoid generating unnecessary modifiers. No modifier is produced in these contexts:

- `static` modifier for nested types within interfaces
- `public` modifier for interface members
- `abstract` modifier for operations within interfaces

Example:

```
interface FooItf {
  def void bar ()
  static class FooItfImpl implements FooItf {
    override void bar () {}
  }
}
```

Old compilation result:

```
public interface FooItf {
  public static class FooItfImpl implements FooItf {
    @Override
    public void bar () {
    }
  }

  public abstract void bar();
}
```

New compilation result:

```
public interface FooItf {
  class FooItfImpl implements FooItf {
    @Override
    void bar () {
    }
  }

  void bar();
}
```
