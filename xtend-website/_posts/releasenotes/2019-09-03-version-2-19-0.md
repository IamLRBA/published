Xtend 2.19.0 is mainly a maintenance release.

## Fixes

* The `Delegate` Active Annotation now uses a stable order.
* Improved `@Override` annotations in generated code.
* Improved ambigous constructor calls.

## Upgrades

Xtend now uses Guava 27.1.0. The new version will be picked up automatically if you make use of the Xtext BOM or consume Xtend from its P2 repository.
