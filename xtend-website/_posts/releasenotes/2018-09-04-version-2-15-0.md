This release focusses on stability, performance and the integration in Eclipse 2018-09.

## Minimal Required Target Platform

Xtext and Xtend 2.15 are built and tested against Eclipse Oxygen.3a and newer. Thus we recommend to use at least Eclipse Oxygen.3a or even better Eclipse 2018-09. For older versions of the Eclipse Platform we cannot guarantee backwards compatibility even though we carefully assess any changes that are made.

## Smarter Organize Imports

In the past there were a couple of corner cases where organize imports did not yield the optimal result. It could even lead to broken code under certain conditions. We fixed these scenarios and organize imports works now nicely even when multicatch or static extensions are involved. 

## Improved Performance of the Gradle Build 

The Gradle build performance was greatly improved. Tasks that consumed lots of memory and even more CPU cycles could be fixed such that is now way faster to build Xtend with Gradle.

## Fixed QuickFixes

In some cases, quick fixes may have broken existing code. That does no longer happen.

## Improved JUnit Support

Test methods must return void to be valid test cases. This is now statically checked by the Xtend validation.

## New API IterableExtensions.reject(Class)

An overloaded variant of `reject()` was added to for convient, type based rejection of elements from an iterable.
