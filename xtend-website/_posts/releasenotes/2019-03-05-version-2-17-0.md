This release focuses on the compatibility with Java 11 & Eclipse 2019-03, stability, performance and technical debt reduction.

## Java 11

Xtend is now fully compliant with Java 11. Java 11 can be chosen as runtime VM and as target version for the compiler.


## xtend-maven-plugin

### BOM managed dependencies

One major pain point with past releases was that the xtend-maven-plugin used ranged dependencies. This lead sometimes to [problems with the plugin execution](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1231), which had to be worked around by clients by explicit dependency management.

Solving this problem was one of the main motivations behind the [introduction of the new Maven BOM](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/releasenotes.html#/releasenotes/2019/03/05/version-2-17-0). With this BOM all external dependencies of Xtext and its Maven plugins are managed in compatible versions without room for interpretation of dependency version ranges.

### Upgrade to Maven 3 API

The `xtext-maven-plugin` has been refactored to use the latest Maven 3 API. The most significant internal change is that all doclet based configurations have been changed to use Maven 3 annotation API.

### Faster startup

The plugin was using version ranges for some of its dependencies, especially Google Guava. Resolving the metadata of these ranged dependencies lead to a short time delay on execution of the plugin. All used dependency versions have been pinned to a single version, which speeds up the plugin execution.

### Resolve usage of deprecated API

The plugin has been refactored to resolve all usages of deprecated API from Eclipse Platform and m2e bundles. ([to issue](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/647))


## Quickfixes

### Quickfix for 'unused private member'

The _unused private member_ issue can now be resolved by a quickfix. The quickfix is capable to resolve multiple selected issues at once when selected from the _Problems_ view. ([details](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/671))

## Deprecations

### Deprecation of Android Archetype

The Maven archetype `org.eclipse.xtend.maven.android.archetype` has been deprecated with this version and is no longer published.

### Deprecation of GWT related artifacts

The bundles `org.eclipse.xtend.lib.gwt` and `org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.lib.gwt` are now deprecated. They are subject for removal in one of the next releases.
