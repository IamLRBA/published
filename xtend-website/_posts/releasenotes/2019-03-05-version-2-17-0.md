This release focuses on stability, performance and the compatibility with Eclipse 2019-03.

## BOM

TODO

## Java 11

Xtend now supports Java 11 as target version.

## Removal of GWT

TODO

## xtend-maven-plugin

### Upgrade to Maven 3 API

The `xtext-maven-plugin` has been refactored to use the latest Maven 3 API. The most significant internal change is that all doclet based configurations have been changed to use Maven 3 annotation API.

### Faster startup

The plugin was using version ranges for some of its dependencies, especially Google Guava. Resolving the metadata of these ranged dependencies lead to a short time delay on execution of the plugin. All used dependency versions have been pinned to a single version, which speeds up the plugin execution.

### Resolve usage of deprecated API

The plugin has been refactored to resolve all usages of deprecated API from Eclipse Platform and m2e bundles. ([to issue](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/647))


## Quickfixes

### Quickfix for 'unused private member'

The _unused private member_ issue can now be resolved by a quickfix. The quickfix is capable to resolve multiple selected issues at once when selected from the _Problems_ view. ([details](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/671))


## Deprecations

### Deprecation of Android Archetype

The Maven archetype `org.eclipse.xtend.maven.android.archetype` has been deprecated with this version and is no longer published.
